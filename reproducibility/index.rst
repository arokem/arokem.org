=======================================
 Reproducibility and open science
=======================================

I was the chair of the `eScience Working Group on Reproducibility and Open
Science <http://uwescience.github.io/reproducible>`_. As part of the activities
of the working group, we are interested in clarifying guidelines for steps that
researchers at UW and elsewhere can take to increase the reproducibility and
openness of their work. As an example, I am publishing here a few of the
activities that I have undertaken to increase the reproducibility and openness
of my own work

Datasets that I have published:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Grasshopper data
----------------

I have made a couple of the data sets that I collected at the `ITB`__ available
on the `CRCNS`__ website:

- `Intracellular recordings from insect auditory receptor <http://crcns.org/data-sets/ia>`_.

__ itb_
__ crcns_


Human MRI data
--------------

High-quality test-retest human diffusion MRI datasets that I collected during my time at the `Stanford Vista Lab`__ were made available through the Stanford Digital Repository:

__ vista_

- `Human brain diffusion-weighted MRI, collected with high diffusion-weighting angular resolution and repeated measurements at multiple diffusion-weighting strength <https://purl.stanford.edu/ng782rw8378>`_

- `Test-retest Diffusion MRI, measured at 1.5 mm isotropic resolution, b-value=2000 s/mm^2 <https://purl.stanford.edu/rt034xr8593>`_

- `Some of these data were also released under the highly permissive PDDL license in: High angular resolution diffusion MRI <https://purl.stanford.edu/yx282xq2090>`_


Software
~~~~~~~~

`Nipy`__ is a community which fosters the collaborative writing of reproducible
research code for neuroimaging in the `Python`__ programming language. I have
made contributiong to many of the libraries within this framework, and I am
currently involved as a core developer in two libraries:

__ nipy_
__ whypython_

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dipy
   nitime


Other software projects:

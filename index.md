## Professional biography

Ariel Rokem received a Bachelors and Masters degree in Biology and Cognitive Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2002 and 2005). He then received a PhD in neuroscience from UC Berkeley (2010) and additional postdoctoral training in computational neuroimaging at Stanford (2011 – 2015). He was a Senior Data Scientist at the University of Washington eScience Institute (2015-2020), before joining the faculty of the Department of Psychology in 2020. His group (https://neuroinformatics.uw.edu/) develops computational tools to study the biological basis of brain function and applies them to a variety of research questions. He is a contributor to Python open-source tools for scientific computing, and a member of the Software and Data Carpentry communities, where he has been an instructor since 2013 and an instructor trainer since 2015. He also directs the NIH-funded Summer Institute for Neuroimaging and Data Science (https://neurohackademy.org/).
